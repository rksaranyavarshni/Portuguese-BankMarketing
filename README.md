Bank is a huge public and private sector that plays an
important part with capital actions like income, saving and
expenditure. Almost every bank invests in identifying their
potential subscribers to their term deposit. This can be done
by passing their customer information to suitable and most
accurate machine learning models. The target column in this
data set will have ”yes” and ”no” which indicates whether a
customer will be a potential subscriber to a term deposit plan
or not respectively. Possible solutions for following question
are discussed in detail in this paper.
1) Can we predict if the customer will subscribe in a term
deposit or not?
2) Which are the most important factors indicating potential
subscription?
